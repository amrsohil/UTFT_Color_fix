# UTFT_Color_fix
Inverted color mode fix for Arduino 3.5″ Color TFT display based on ILI9481 Driver.
I bought a cheap Arduino 3.5″ Color TFT display shield and found that colors are inverted (Black is white, etc ..).
I had to modify the UTFT Library (UTFT.cpp) from Rinky-Dink Electronics to correct the color inversion.
